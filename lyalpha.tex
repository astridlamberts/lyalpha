\section{Introduction}

Only $10\%$ of the baryons in the present-day universe are in collapsed structures such as galaxies, clusters and groups \citep{2012ApJ...759...23S} \Ec{[Not sure if we should quote this number. I just looked into a simulated box and found that the sum of M200c of all halos is 40\% of the total mass in the box at z=0.]}. The vast majority of ordinary matter is in a more diffuse state around galaxies (forming the circumgalactic medium) and  between them, forming the intergalactic medium \citep[IGM, see][for a recent review]{2016ARA&A..54..313M}. The latter is composed of gas around  and below the cosmic mean density $\Delta$. As such, its evolution is mostly linear, closely follows the underlying dark matter and is directly influenced by fundamental cosmological parameters \citep{2013A&A...559A..85P,2013JCAP...04..026S,2015JCAP...11..011P}.  As the main reservoir for baryons,  its physical state sets the initial conditions for star formation.

Because of its linear nature, the IGM is an excellent calorimeter of energy injected by star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN). More specifically, re-ionization of H and HeI around $z\simeq 10-6$ \citep{2006ARA&A..44..415F} and then HeII around $z\geqslant 3.5$ \Ec{[I think this is still controversial. May have finished at $z<3$.]} provide most of the heat input in the IGM \citep{2009ApJ...694..842M,2011ApJ...733L..24W}. \Ec{Subsequently, the thermal evolution of the IGM is set by photoheating following recombinations and adiabatic cooling. Due to the Hubble expansion the IGM globally cools. The lowest density gas expands fastest and also receives least photoheating as there are fewer recombinations that allow subsequent photoionizations. Together this yields a tight temperature-density relation $T=T_0 \Delta ^{\gamma-1}$ for low density gas where $T_0$ is the temperature at the mean density and $\gamma$ asymptotically approaches $\simeq 1.6$  long after HeII reionization \citep{1997MNRAS.292...27H,2015MNRAS.450.4081P,2016MNRAS.456...47M}}. Recent models of HeII re-ionisation, based on cosmological simulations including complete radiative transfer, indicate a patchy process yielding a broadening of the temperature-density distribution around mean density for $z\simeq 3$ \citep{2009ApJ...694..842M,2012MNRAS.423....7M,2013MNRAS.435.3169C}.

The most dramatic impact on the low-density IGM could come from TeV-blazar heating \citep{2012ApJ...752...23C,2012MNRAS.423..149P,2015ApJ...811...19L}, with potential impact on structure formation \citep{2012ApJ...752...24P}. This model is based on the electron/positron beams that result from the annihilation of very high energy gamma-rays from blazars on the extragalactic background light. They can be subject to plasma instabilities, which efficiently redistribute their kinetic energy to the surrounding intergalactic medium \citep{2012ApJ...752...22B,2013ApJ...777...49S,2012ApJ...758..102S,2014ApJ...797..110C,2016ApJ...833..118C},  but see \citet{2013ApJ...770...54M,2014ApJ...787...49S}.  

\ALc{[Need paragraph about fermi stuff and quasar and blazar evolution here]}

The resulting heating is only limited by the number of TeV-photons, which makes it a competitive heating source in the underdense regions, where photoheating is rendered impossible as the recombination time is larger than the Hubble time.  Assuming a uniform heating rate, it results in an inverted temperature-density distribution below the cosmic mean, with low density gas reaching  $10^5$K at $z=3$ and $\simeq 10^6$K in the present-day universe \citep{2012MNRAS.423..149P}.  

While uniform heating is a reasonable first order approximation, in \citet[hereafter Paper~I]{2015ApJ...811...19L} we showed that it is affected by the clustering of blazars. As a result, regions close to large overdense regions such as clusters or groups are receiving more heat than remote regions mostly surrounded by voids.  In our favoured model, where TeV blazars have the same bias than quasars, there are almost two orders of magnitude between the hottest and warmest gas between $z\simeq 2-3$ although the bulk of the gas follows a temperature consistent with the uniform model. By the present day, all regions have been heated up and the uniform model provides a good description of the impact of blazar heating.


Observational confirmation of blazar heating is a challenge, because it mostly affects low-density regions. The IGM is mostly observed through absorption lines within the spectra of distant quasars,  due to a tiny fraction of neutral hydrogen \citep{1971ApJ...164L..73L}. The so-called Ly$\alpha$ forest can be observed with ground-based facilities for $z\geq 1.7$ and a variety of statistics have been developed to analyse spectra from a wide range of instruments. However, deriving the physical parameters of the IGM from the different statistics requires a careful comparison with cosmological simulations \citep[see e.g.][]{1997ApJ...489....7R,2000MNRAS.318..817S,2013MNRAS.436.1023B,2017MNRAS.464..897B}. Because of the intrinsic observational challenges, numerical shortcomings and difficulty to establish the validity of the different statistics,  there is no observational consensus on the thermal state of the low-density IGM.
%and the difficulty to establish   %So far, there is no observational consensus on the thermal state of the IGM.

Based on the probability distribution function (PDF) of the transmitted flux, \citet{2007MNRAS.382.1657K,2008MNRAS.386.1131B,2009MNRAS.399L..39V,2012MNRAS.422.3019C} find that an isothermal ($\gamma=1$) or inverted $(\gamma\leq 1$) are in good agreement with the data. However, the flux PDF can be strongly affected by systematic errors in the continuum placement \citep{2012ApJ...753..136L} and sample variance \citep{2013MNRAS.428..540R}. Analysis of the curvature of the Ly$\alpha$ spectrum \citep{2011MNRAS.410.1096B,2014MNRAS.441.1916B} prefers a warmer temperature of the IGM. However, this method, which is based on the smoothness of the spectrum, is mostly sensitive to densities above the mean, especially at low redshift. Finally, Voight profile fitting of the spectra yields the distribution of line-width (b) versus HI column density ($N_{HI}$). Using the lower envelope of the distribution as a proxy for the $T-\rho$ relation, \citet{2012ApJ...757L..30R,2014MNRAS.438.2499B} find no evidence of blazar heating.


 Based a unique spectrum, with exceptional signal-to-noise  (S/N) and resolution, \citet{2017MNRAS.466.2690R} can rescale the optical depth to enhance the signal from low-density regions. At the considered redshifts ($2.5\leq z \leq 3$), they do find that the 
high end of the transmitted flux probability distribution is better matched by a broken powerlaw for the temperature-density distribution, with an inverted slope at the low density end. Their model including temperature fluctuations at low densities produces a satisfactory match as well. The authors also perform a careful analysis of the power spectrum and lower envelope of the ``$b-N_{HI}$'' distribution and show they are largely  unsensitive to the low-density regions.

\ALc{[Do we need a paragraph about low-z measurements?]}

In this paper, we perform confront our model for inhomogeneous blazar heating with observational data. We first describe the numerical simulations we use to model the IGM (\S\ref{sec:sims}) and the resulting observables we derive (\S\ref{sec:obs}). We then discuss the direct comparison with observations (\S\ref{sec:discussion}) and conclude (\S\ref{sec:conclusion}).



\section{Cosmological simulations}\label{sec:sims}

Our simulations are very similar to the simulations presented in Paper I and are performed at higher resolution. In this section we remind the reader of their relevant characteristics. 

We perform our simulations with \textsc{GADGET-3}, which is and upgraded version of \textsc{GADGET-2} \citep{2005MNRAS.364.1105S}.  It is based on a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme and solves the gravitational evolution of gas and dark matter with a TREE-PM N-body method.  The equations of hydrodynamics are solved with an entropy conserving scheme based on \citep{2002MNRAS.333..649S}.   Our simulations are based on the cosmological parameters based on  the \textit{Planck} data combined with lensing, \textit{WMAP} and high multipole measurements \citep{2014A&A...571A..16P}: $\Omega_M = 0.305$, $\Omega_{\lambda} = 0.694$, $\Omega_B = 0.0481$, $h = 0.679$, $\sigma_8 = 0.827$ and $n_s$ = 0.962.  These values are slightly updated with respect to the simulations presented in \citep{2012MNRAS.423..149P,2015ApJ...811...19L}. \ALc{[I don't expect this to have any influence, is that correct?]}

We start our simulations based on initial conditions evolved up to redshift $z=110$ and stop our simulations at $z=1.74$, beyond which observational date is sparse and underdense regions not well sampled. As this work focusses on the IGM, we use a simplified model for star formation, where gas particles with  density $\delta_{\mathrm{gas}}\geq 1000$ and T $\leq 10^5$ are directly converted into stars \citep{2004MNRAS.354..684V}. While this can yield inaccurate galaxy properties, it does not affect the low-density IGM and significantly speeds up the simulations. We also neglect direct black hole feedback.


\ALc{[Paragraph about UV  background and related stuff here]}

We perform a set of three simulations, one without any blazar heating, one with uniform blazar heating and one with inhomogeneous blazar heating.  The three simulations are run with identical initial conditions. The uniform blazar heating model is identical to the ``intermediate heating'' model presented in \citet{2012MNRAS.423..149P}.  Our inhomogeneous model has the same total amount of energy injected by blazars while accounting for regions receiving more or less heating according to their proximity to heating sources. The model is fully described in Paper I  and is based on an analytic formalism relating the distribution of the heating rate to the underlying dark matter distribution. It results in the  filtering function shown on Fig.~\ref{fig:window}, which  removes small scale fluctuations and enhances fluctuations beyond $\simeq 10$ h$^{-1}$ Mpc at $z=4$ and $\simeq 40$ h$^{-1}$ Mcp at $z=2$.  The shape and redshift evolution of the  window function is set by the mean free path of the VHEGR combined with the bias of the heating sources.  While we presented two models in Paper I, with galaxy bias and quasar bias, in this work we focus on the model with quasar bias, which is probably more representative of the bias of TeV blazars.  

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
 \includegraphics[width = .45\textwidth ]{window_qso}
\caption{Window function for TeV blazar heating for $z=1$ (dotted line), $z=2$ (dot-dashed line), $z=3$ (dashed line)  and $z=4$ (solid line).  The vertical dashed line indicate the minimal comoving wavenumber modeled in the simulation.}
\label{fig:window}
\end{figure}

Because of the typical length scale of the heating rate fluctuations, our simulation have a comoving sidelength of  a $100$ h$^{-1}$ Mpc.  Tests in Paper I showed that this is a sufficiently large size to properly sample the full range of temperature fluctuations. \ALc{Discuss resolution here}. 



%We use $N= 2\times 512^3$ particles, which gives a mass of $m_\mathrm{gas}=3.8\times10^{6} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ and $m_\mathrm{DM}=1.8\times 10^{7} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ for baryonic and dark matter particles, respectively. We used a comoving gravitational softening length of 7.8 $h^{-1}$ kpc. We checked that the resolution has a barely discernible impact on the results of our simulations by performing test simulations with a comoving side length of 50 $h^{-1}$ Mpc at different resolutions, up to $2\times 512^3$. The spread of the temperature in the low density regions increases with increasing resolution. However, this effect is approaching saturation at a resolution of $N=2\times 256^3$. We find less than $4\%$ difference in the median temperature and less than $10\%$ difference in its root mean square in low density regions between $N=2\times 256^3$ and $2\times 512^3$ simulations, indicating that our chosen resolution is sufficient to accurately capture the temperature-density distribution. 

% Photoheating is set by ionization equilibrium of H, He\,\textsc{I} and He\,\textsc{II} in the presence of an external UV field, which is parameterized according to \citet{2009ApJ...703.1416F}. As our version of the \textsc{GADGET-3} code assumes ionization equilibrium when computing photoheating rates, the heating is rather inefficient during reionization where this assumption is not well satisfied \citep[see e.g.][]{2014arXiv1410.1531P}. Following \citet{2012MNRAS.423..149P} we thus include the equivalent heat input by hand at redshift $z=10$. Our simulation does not include radiative transfer effects on the photoionization of He\,\textsc{II}.



\section{Comparison with observations}\label{sec:obs}
\subsection{Inhomegenous blazar heating}
Fig.~\ref{fig:rho_T} shows the temperature-density distribution in our inhomogeneous heating model. The complete description of the inhomogeneous heating model are described in Paper I. Here we recall the main characteristics of the temperature-density distribution, which most observations try to infer. As time goes by, the cumulated impact of blazar heating increases, with a higher temperature difference with respect to the unheated case. Still, as some regions are too far from heating sources, they remain cold, as can be seen by the remnant cold gas, especially at $z=3$. This is very different from the uniform heating model (shown in black) and can potentially reconcile the blazar heating model with observations of absorption lines with Doppler parameter ($b\leq 20$ km s$^{-1}$). At the redshifts most accessible with the Ly$\alpha$ forest, the temperature range  covers almost two orders of magnitude at the lowest density and  even around mean density, there is an important spread. At lower redshifts, the whole IGM gets heated up and after $z\geqslant1$, the inhomogeneous model recovers the uniform model.  In the following section, we compare the observables derived from this $T-\rho$ distribution with observational data.

\subsection{Post-processing the simulations}
We compare our simulations with different heating models with observations of the Ly$\alpha$ forest, focusing on statistics that are sensitive to low density regions. First, we extract 100 lines of sight from each output. The lines of sight are randomly selected and aligned along the main axes of the simulation. For each line of sight, we determine the density, velocity, temperature and resulting optical depth of HI along 2048 equally spaced bins.

\item Global flow , potential caveats
\item Details about subdividing LOS in chunks for VPFIT
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Ly$\alpha$ forest statistics}



\subsection{Thermal state of the IGM}
To compare with the rescaled flux PDF by \citet{2017MNRAS.466.2690R}, we carefully perform the same steps. First, we rescale the optical depth so that the mean transmitted flux $F$ matches the observed value at that redshift \citep{2013MNRAS.436.1023B}. We perform this operation at once for all lines of sight resulting from the same output.  Then, we smooth the flux with a Gaussian of full width at half maximum of $7.2$ km s$^{-1}$ (to model the aperture of the slit) and rebin it into bins of $\Delta v=2.5$ km s$^{-1}$ (resolution of the UVES spectrograph). We then add Gaussian noise with $\sigma=(\sigma_0^2+F(\sigma_c^2-\sigma_0^2))^{1/2}$ with $\sigma_0=0.0028$ and $\sigma_c=0.0088$ (see Appendix F in \citet{2017MNRAS.466.2690R})

To avoid uncertainties due to continuum placement, we then rescale the transmitted flux to the transmitted flux in the 95$^{th}$ percentile. The latter is close to the peak of the flux PDF, and is therefore less noisy than the mean. This operation performed independently for each line of sight, in chunks of size 10 Mpc/h. Finally, to enhance the impact of low density regions, we rescale the optical depth by a factor $A=10$, which yield a rescaled transmitted flux $F_A=F^A$.


Fig.~\ref{fig:PDF_A} shows the PDF of $F_A$ in our three different heating models, compared with the observed PDF. To properly compare the observed spectrum with the simulation, we have to reconstruct identical lines of sight from the simulations. The outputs of our simulations are separated by $dz=0.1$, starting at $z=3$. To reconstruct the line of sight, we stitch together subsections of lines of sight from all outputs between $z=3$ and $z=2.6$. For each output, the size of the subsection is set by the comoving distance $dl$ corresponding to $dz=0.1$ for the considered redshift. The first pixel of the subsection is randomly chosen along the line of sight and we use the periodic boundary conditions to complete the line of sight if the edge of the computational box is reached before $dl$ is completed. The lines of sight are randomly chosen for each output. While this produces small discontinuities at the junctions of the subsections, it is a more realistic representation of the varying cosmic structure that would be encountered by a photon \citep[see e.g.][for a discussion]{2016arXiv161203935H}. 

As the observed line of sight is unique, cosmic variance can significantly affect the resulting flux PDF \citep{2013MNRAS.428..540R,2017MNRAS.466.2690R}. To provide some measurement of the spread of the flux PDF, we recreate a total of one hundred  lines of sight from each of our simulations. The pink and red regions in Fig.~\ref{fig:PDF_allz_100lines} show the resulting one and two sigma deviations from the mean. While we are confident that we do not oversample specific locations of the simulation, in PaperI we showed that the typical length scale  of heated/unheated regions is of a few tens of Mpc/h. As such, the number of regions sampled by our simulation is somewhat limited and we likely underestimate cosmic variance. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:PDF_A} shows that the rescaled flux PDF of the Lyman $\alpha$ forest cannot be reproduced by a model without additional heating before or around $2.5<z<3$. Inhomogeneous blazar heating does provide a flux PDF compatible with observations. The uniform model, where the same total amount of blazar heating is injected, shows less good agreement with the data. This model has less physical motivation, as blazar heating is naturally inhomogeneous, because of the biased distribution of the sources.  At the redshifts considered, the impact of extended and/or late HeII reionization cannot be ruled out \ALc{[Although it might be more uniform in this case? ]}.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}

The impact of HeII reionization on the temperature of the IGM cannot be ruled out for $z>2.5$. As such, a clear signature of a heating source in low density IGM, for which blazar heating is currently the only candidate, can only be firmly established with lower redshift measurements. While $z<2.5$ data is present in the DEEP spectrum, the data contains both Ly$\alpha$ and Ly$\beta$ absorption lines, which makes the analysis more complex and prone to uncertainties, especially when the sample is limited. Figure ~\ref{fig:PDF_predict} shows the predicted PDF of the rescaled flux between $2.5<z<2$ for the three models we consider. High signal-to-noise, high spectral resolution lines-of-sight towards quasars located between $2.2\lesssim z \lesssim 2,7$ (not contaminated by Ly$\beta$ absorption) will be able to discriminate between a heated and non-heated model.
